A modern, accessible, and extensible React component library for building consistent UIs. Built with Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Storybook.

## ✨ Features
- **Accessible React components** (Accordion, Alert, Avatar, Badge, Menubar, Select, etc.)
- **Radix UI primitives** for robust, cross-browser UI behaviors
- **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for rapid styling
- **Storybook** for interactive component documentation and development
- **Vite** for fast local development
- **Inline SVG icons** (no external icon dependencies)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 3. Run Next.js Dev Server
